# _msieve-bits_
Minor mods to Jason P's factorization powerhouse _msieve_.

_msieve_ can be found at https://github.com/MersenneForum/msieve.


*Note that the modifications recorded in this project have purposely not been submitted to the _msieve_ project.
The mods are incomplete and concern behaviors that Jason has specifically said he's not interested in providing.
His interests lie elsewhere, which is totally fine.*
